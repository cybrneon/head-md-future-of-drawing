# Today's Work

## 3D Print
My 3d print was done and it was so nice to see the final result.

## Talking with Laure
The comments from yesterday still apply! Now, for the micro-switch to be positionned inside of the shape and for the pencil to activate it, it needs a base or something that presses the micro-switch enough.

## Talking with Douglas
We talked alot and deeply into my project. Looking at how I can make my project come to life.

### Software
#### 1st Step
<b>Making a simple python program that detects the switch and plays mp3s.</b>
<br>
Using pull-ups, I don't need a resistor. So one cable goes into the GPIO 4 pin, and the other goes to the GND. The electrical current will go from the pin number 4, stop, and only go to the ground when the micro-switch is pressed.
<br>
<b>Tools:</b> python-vlc (included).

`Code will go here when I'll boot up the RPI next time to save my progress`

#### 2nd Step
<b>Making a script that communicates with an API to generate text, generate text-to-speech and play it back on the RPI.</b>
<br>
This one is the most trickiest one, but is not impossible.
<br>
<b>Tools:</b> Bard, Google TTS, Piper, Hugginface, ...

### Story
And finaly, the most important thing in my project. Douglas compared storytelling to a campfire story, a comparison I simply find soooo beautiful and true.
To use it and let the AI _d√©lirer_ with what I'll give it, I need to do sections like #Start, #EveningEvent, #End, ...

## Getting the textiles for the speaker wrap
So I went to IKEA, even though it was my day off, but I went home with nice textile huts from curtains. From thin to thick, I took 4 colors.
