# This Morning's Experiments

Subjects have to draw one card from the WHAT and another from the HOW card stacks.
| WHAT | HOW |
| -------- | ------- |
| Draw the Map of a city | Draw sitting with your head facing up |
| Draw a hill with flowers on it | Draw and sync your breathing to the strokes |
| Draw a road that leads to the horizon | Draw while kneeling |
| Draw the shore of a city you like | Draw while having a string attached to the pen/sensor |
| Draw your view of a futuristic city | Draw with one foot levitating |
| Draw and imagine a whole new planet | Draw with your hands in the air |
| Draw an alien ship landing on earth | Draw with your head only, while keeping your eyes closed |
| Draw an island in the middle of the ocean  | Draw with both your hands glued together |
<br>

## Subject A
### Before
Stressed a bit in the beggining.
<br>
**PROMPT:** Draw a road that leads to the horizon (WHAT). Draw while kneeling (HOW).

### During
The subject drawed with confidence and tried to do perfect lines.

### After
Cool result, and fun experience.

> At this moment, I was like, okay it's probably going to be boring, what if I spice things up by asking people to close their eyes. **And THAT my friend, gave interesting results.**

> I also started commenting people's work, giving them context and ideas, while drawing having their eyes closed.

## Subject B
### Before
Stressed a bit in the beggining.
<br>
**PROMPT:** Draw an island in the middle of the ocean (WHAT). Draw and sync your breathing to the strokes (HOW).

### During
After 1 minute, the subject didn't have an idea of what to add more to their drawing. So I came in and started commenting and asking questions like:
- Is that boat a diesel or steam one?
- Do humans live on that island?
- What animals live on that island?
- Is it sunrise, midnight ...?
- etc. etc. etc.

### After
Cool result, and fun experience. Much better, giving me context.


## Subject C
**PROMPT:** Draw a hill with flowers on it (WHAT). Draw with your hands in the air (HOW).
This subject wanted to finish as quickly as possible (1min).

## Subject D
**PROMPT:** Draw an island in the middle of the ocean (WHAT). Draw sitting with your head facing up (HOW).


## Alexia Mathieu
The experience was supercharged with Douglas laughing at Alexia's unmatched spacial skills, but it showed me lots of flaws and things I can improve.

# Comments from Alexia and Douglas
- During the experience, I was a too gentle and too nice. Missed opportunity there, I need a better personality.
- I need to create a storytelling tool for me so I can control the story and provide adequate questions to the subject when the experiment is running.
- I have the role of the AI currently, but I can also let the AI decide and 'd√©lirer' over the storytelling that the person chooses.
- I also should have an ending or a resolution at the end (Can be part of the scenario).
