# Process

## Goal
I tried finding new drawing experiences with the goal to reduce daily stress.

## Unusual Drawing Experiences
Unusual Drawing Experiences:
- Drawing with your hands in the air
- Drawing with a pen in your elbow
- Collaborative drawing (with a friend, taking turns to draw)
- Mouth painting (holding a pen in the mouth and drawing)
- String Art, attaching a string to the pen and controlling the drawing
- Foot drawing, using feets to draw on a large canvas

Mindful Meditation Drawing:
- Blindfold drawing, drawing a specific object or scene from memory
- Breathing Patterns, syncing inhaling and exhaling with line drawings for ex
- Drawing with your non-dominant hand
