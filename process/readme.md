# The Process

## Goal
I started researching the subject of everyday stress, stress in general, chronic stress, its reaction on the body. I also red people's questions and answers on Reddit for when people ask about how can they manage stress, in which people usually detail their stress relief methods to others.
Then, I looked at alternative drawing techniques, to tackle everyday stress.
