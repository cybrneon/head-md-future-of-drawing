# The Process

## Goal
I started researching the subject of everyday stress, stress in general, chronic stress, its reaction on the body. I also red people's questions and answers on Reddit for when people ask about how can they manage stress, in which people usually detail their stress relief methods to others.
Then, I looked at alternative drawing techniques, to tackle everyday stress.

## Drawing Experiences
### Unusual Drawing Experiences
- Drawing with your hands in the air
- Drawing with a pen in your elbow
- Collaborative drawing (with a friend, taking turns to draw)
- Mouth painting (holding a pen in the mouth and drawing)
- String Art, attaching a string to the pen and controlling the drawing
- Foot drawing, using feets to draw on a large canvas

### Mindful Meditation Drawing:
- Blindfold drawing, drawing a specific object or scene from memory
- Breathing Patterns, syncing inhaling and exhaling with line drawings for ex
- Drawing with your non-dominant hand


## Interview Process
More importantly, I wanted to learn about people's techniques, if they had some. That's why I wrote questions that I then asked to different people in a face-to-face interview.

### First Part of the interview
I asked to rate their daily stress levels, why they were stressed, if they had stress relief techniques, if they were efficient, and if they tried drawing.

### Second Part of the Interview
I then asked to choose one of the drawing techniques I talked about earlier, and it gave lots of really nice results.

### Results
In all of these experiments, people kept saying that they were having fun! At first, I thought people would feel frustrated, but they kept going and adapted to the situation.

What I also find interesting in the interview process, is that when I asked people to rate their daily stress levels, the majority of them gave me a mark out of 10. Even if each person has its own meaning of stress, I was surprised to see how everyone tried to agree on a rating out of 10.

One of the other interessting aspects is the fact that one person talked about having a routine, which is super interessting.

Others talked about how they hate temporary solutions, which is understandable because I don't like them either.

## Aftermath of First Insights Presentation
Here are the comments I've gotten from Alexia, Douglas and collegues:
- Keep experimenting!
- The notion of gaming will probably emerge (gamification).
- Spirituality?
- Engaging the whole body?
- Mandalas


# Prototyping? with Paper!
## First Try
At first, I drew the following cards:
- Inks
- Poker Face
- Figuration
- Peltier

I then made an interactive Captcha machine that asks you to draw something on it to confirm you're human, with a voice that asks you why you're drawing things the way you're drawing them and not giving any emotion.

## Experimentation
We then started to imagine interactions and paper experiments with our subjects. I didn't know how or where to start, so I came back to the cards and drew ones that I then executed into paper prototypes.

## The First Concept
After the experimentation, it was time to form a first Concept.
Thinking of personalities like Dreamy, A bit too much, Spy, Cheerleader.

## Important Insights
**Routine:** Setting up a routine in the morning or afternoon can be beneficial. Ex: Doing an exercise for 5min in the morning or before bed.
**Stress Level Rating:** Listening to the user's stress level and providing the adequate solution as a drawing experience.
**Positive Comments:** Reassuring the user doint that he's drawing nicely, and maybe provide comments and suggestions (always positive).
**A box:** A small device that can be put in a living room and blend with its space. Ex: Hi-Fi, TV, Clock, Books, Game console, ...
**Interactions:**
- Tap to wake? at the top?
- No smartphone interaction! (no stress in the morning)
- K.I.S.S.
- Was thinking of a sensor attached to a pen, but I think it would be more intereseting to "draw" in the air, with nothing but a sensor (Wii-mote, Kinect). -> Drawing in a space without knowing what you're drawing is pretty interesting. (I have to test that!!!)

## How can the machine function?
1. Turn the machine on (wake it up) by tapping at the top.

![Alt text](/process/2023-10-30/20231030_092858617_iOS.jpeg)

2. By that, I communicate the level of stress I'm feeling right now.
3. The machine gives me a prompt to draw with a WHAT and a HOW.
4. With the pen (or the sensor on the finger), the machine understands what I'm drawing and comments on it.
5. After drawing for 3 to 5 minutes, time is up! The machine now shows you the art you've created, and asks you how it went so that it can adapt to you.

## Comments I got from Alexia, Douglas and collegues:
- I need to challenge myself by removing text, and screens (no chatbot-like interactions)
- Be careful not to do too much industrial design. I should focus more on the interactions.
- The routine question is interesting and important. Need to do more research about that.
