#  Progress of the day

The software is done. I just need to work on the story and push it through Text-To-Speech.

The presentation is almost done, I only need images of the device and small refinements here and there.

## Check-up with Douglas
I'm on the right track, here's what's remaining to do.
- Find a better solution for the pen detection, putting weight into the top of the pen like lead (plomb), and not using ugly wood.
- Story creation with AI.
- Software corrections and boot setup.
- Presentation and Project Documentation
