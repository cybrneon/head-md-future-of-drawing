# Initial Process

## Goal
I started researching the subject of everyday stress, stress in general, chronic stress, its reaction on the body. I also red people's questions and answers on Reddit for when people ask about how can they manage stress, in which people usually detail their stress relief methods to others.
Then, I looked at alternative drawing techniques, to tackle everyday stress.

## Drawing Experiences

> You can find my Mind Map and Interview Process on my [Figjam board](https://www.figma.com/file/ohNOqJvYwTzFk34S5s9SKd/Atelier-MD1---Mind-Map-%2B-Field-Research?type=whiteboard&node-id=93%3A457&t=TbDTdXIz9qEikPVk-1).

### Unusual Drawing Experiences
- Drawing with your hands in the air
- Drawing with a pen in your elbow
- Collaborative drawing (with a friend, taking turns to draw)
- Mouth painting (holding a pen in the mouth and drawing)
- String Art, attaching a string to the pen and controlling the drawing
- Foot drawing, using feets to draw on a large canvas

### Mindful Meditation Drawing:
- Blindfold drawing, drawing a specific object or scene from memory
- Breathing Patterns, syncing inhaling and exhaling with line drawings for ex
- Drawing with your non-dominant hand

## Interview Process
More importantly, I wanted to learn about people's techniques, if they had some. That's why I wrote questions that I then asked to different people in a face-to-face interview.

### First Part of the interview
I asked to rate their daily stress levels, why they were stressed, if they had stress relief techniques, if they were efficient, and if they tried drawing.

### Second Part of the Interview
I then asked to choose one of the drawing techniques I talked about earlier, and it gave lots of really nice results.

### Results
In all of these experiments, people kept saying that they were having fun! At first, I thought people would feel frustrated, but they kept going and adapted to the situation.

What I also find interesting in the interview process, is that when I asked people to rate their daily stress levels, the majority of them gave me a mark out of 10. Even if each person has its own meaning of stress, I was surprised to see how everyone tried to agree on a rating out of 10.

One of the other interessting aspects is the fact that one person talked about having a routine, which is super interessting.

Others talked about how they hate temporary solutions, which is understandable because I don't like them either.

## Aftermath of First Insights Presentation
Here are the comments I've gotten from Alexia, Douglas and collegues:
- Keep experimenting!
- The notion of gaming will probably emerge (gamification).
- Spirituality?
- Engaging the whole body?
- Mandalas
