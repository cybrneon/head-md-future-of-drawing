# Tuesday prototyping!

Before prototyping, I need to be clear on the interactions I have with my device and assistant.

- I can either keep the drawing that is displayed on a screen at the end of the experience or I can remove the need for a screen and use physical paper and real pens without connection with the machine, and the device just becomes a talking storytelling machine.

- Or I could still use a screen, but as Laure said it has to be low-tech not to be distracting. It could probably be a small screen just to indicate status or something.

I'll probably prototype in the afternoon.

# Rihno course with Laure
Even though I enjoy doing 3d modeling and rendering, Rhino has so many buttons, options and menus that I didn't understand a thing of how Laure did her salt dispenser...

# Preparing the Presentation with the Template
A template? okay I hope it's not going to be boring with CdA people.

I really hope we can do our own presentations with our own designs at the end of the project.
