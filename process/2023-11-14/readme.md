# Tuesday prototyping!

Before prototyping, I need to be clear on the interactions I have with my device and assistant.

- I can either keep the drawing that is displayed on a screen at the end of the experience or I can remove the need for a screen and use physical paper and real pens without connection with the machine, and the device just becomes a talking storytelling machine.

- Or I could still use a screen, but as Laure said it has to be low-tech not to be distracting. It could probably be a small screen just to indicate status or something.

I'll probably prototype in the afternoon.

# Rihno course with Laure
Even though I enjoy doing 3d modeling and rendering, Rhino has so many buttons, options and menus that I didn't understand a thing of how Laure did her salt dispenser...

# Preparing the Presentation with the Template
A template? okay I hope it's not going to be boring with CdA people.

I really hope we can do our own presentations with our own designs at the end of the project.

# Trying the storytelling experience on a psychologist friend
She liked it and found it very interesting. She also gave me different and interesting insights.

# Making my interactions clear
## THE User Journey
1. The user turns the assistant ON by tapping on it. The assistant then detects the stress level of the person according to the force they used to tap on the device.
2. The assistant will pick a scenario based on the current stress of its user.
3. The assistant asks the user to close their eyes and get ready for a 5 minutes countdown.
4. The user begins drawing.
5. While the user is drawing, the assistant will give comments and ask questions in real time. If the user picked the "Draw a Map of a City" card, the questions could be:
    - What Time is it?
    - How are people dressed?
    - Is there a smell or particular odor you have in mind?
6. At the end of the countdown, the assistant asks the user to open their eyes.
7. The user now sees their drawing in front of them.
8. The assistant says goodbye and turns OFF.

## Talking with Laure
We talked about two ways to approach the subject. Either I go with something meditative, or go with something fun (more about escaping reality).

And I need to decide myself.

<b>So I think I'm going with the second one actually, because people really enjoyed the experiences tested on them and found it really fun.</b>

So tapping the device to measure stress in not applicable anymore.

In terms of form and shape, Laure gave me some interesting references:

## THE BRAND NEW User Journey
1. The user turns the assistant ON by removing a pen from the 4 pen holder.
2. The assistant will pick a scenario based on the pen the user took.
3. The assistant asks the user to close their eyes and get ready for a 5 minutes countdown.
4. The user begins drawing.
5. While the user is drawing, the assistant will give comments and ask questions in real time. If the user picked the "Draw a Map of a City" card, the questions could be:
    - What Time is it?
    - How are people dressed?
    - Is there a smell or particular odor you have in mind?
6. At the end of the countdown, the assistant asks the user to open their eyes.
7. The user now sees their drawing in front of them.
8. The assistant says goodbye and turns OFF.
