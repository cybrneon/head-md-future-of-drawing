## Ateliers
Sooooo, yesterday and today was the first day I put my feet in the Prototyping and Metal pool in my whole time at HEAD. So champagne üçæü•Ç.
With Fred, I checked how I can make my shape and device come to reality. He told me I can do it with 3d printing. When I checked in the metal pool, Xavier told me that it wasn't possible to do there.

I also checked with the materials, and I think I'll need to find something suitable. For the "aluminium" part of my pen holder, I'll probably spray an aluminium color on it.

Here's a compilation of all the materials I saw there:
