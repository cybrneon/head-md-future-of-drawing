This is THE device. With speakers inside, and the micro-switch.

## Ateliers
Sooooo, yesterday and today was the first day I put my feet in the Prototyping and Metal pool in my whole time at HEAD. So champagne üçæü•Ç.
With Fred, I checked how I can make my shape and device come to reality. He told me I can do it with 3d printing. When I checked in the metal pool, Xavier told me that it wasn't possible to do there.

I also checked with the materials, and I think I'll need to find something suitable. For the "aluminium" part of my pen holder, I'll probably spray an aluminium color on it.

Here's a compilation of all the materials I saw there:

## Preparing for Test Day (D-2)

For the test day, I'm thinking of testing two stories and see what people like more, how they react to them, how inspired they are, etc.

Now I'm asking myself, what can I test on people who never seen or heard of the project?
<br>
-Stories.
<br>
What stories?
<br>
I can probably test the speed of the narration? like if there are blanks in between and if there are not?
<br>
I can also test with a voice synthesis and a recorded one?

### Story 1
Once upon a time, a river.
<br>
Rolling down the Akira Mountains, north of Selestia.
<br>
At the end of the river, a small village, built by a couple after they encountered diamonds in the river.
<br>
And this is why the river is called the Marvelous Diamond River.
<br>
The couple, named Gigi governed the small village for a few years now, they even have their own palace.
<br>
Each year, the tradition states that every first of the month at 3PM, people run from the north to the south of the village, following the river, and dive into the Clear Blue Diamond Lake.
<br>
North of the village, a cook and shopkeeper, always ready to delight and make everyday special for the inhabitants of the village. By cooking a delicious stew for instance!
<br>
A few steps from the shopkeeper, a carpenter, who's only job is to build houses for the many new comers to the village.
