# Test Day Prep

## Call with Douglas
We need to have goals. I need to ask questions for me.
> I'm thinking probably testing one story reading it with pauses and seeing how people react and absorb the information to end up drawing. And the same story where I read it in a go without pauses?

This is too subtle!
<br>
I need to see the nature of the story
How much information I give to the user, How much I give to the person that's going to draw.

## Story 1 - original
Once upon a time, a river.
<br>
<br>
Rolling down the Akira Mountains, north of the coutry of Selestia.
<br>
<br>
At the end of the river, a small village, built by a couple after they encountered diamonds in the river.
<br>
<br>
And this is why the river is called the Marvelous Diamond River.
<br>
<br>
The couple, named Gigi governed the small village for a few years now, they even have their own palace.
<br>
<br>
Each year, the tradition states that every first of the month at 3PM, people run from the north to the south of the village, following the river, and dive into the Clear Blue Diamond Lake for a chance to find diamonds.
<br>
<br>
The lakeside is full of people coming from a number of different countries, here to witness the miracle, and why not be part of it.
<br>
<br>
That day in the crowd, a person by the name of Ash just finished their run and dive, was standing next to the lake thinking of what she'll be eating this evening.
<br>
<br>
Ash came to the lakeside with their dog, Ruffus.

## Story 1 - variation 1 (detailed with Bard)

In the heart of the majestic Akira Mountains, nestled amidst the snow-capped peaks and verdant valleys, flowed a magnificent river, its waters shimmering like a cascade of diamonds. This was the marvelous Diamond River, a source of wonder and fascination for the people of Selestia, the land that lay north of its meandering course.
<br>
<br>
Legends whispered of its magical origins, tales of a couple who stumbled upon its crystal-clear depths, discovering amidst the swirling currents a treasure of untold value – diamonds, embedded within the riverbed like glittering stars. Enthralled by their discovery, the couple established a small village at the river's end, naming it Diamond Village in honor of its precious namesake.
<br>
<br>
Over the centuries, the village grew in prosperity, its inhabitants living in harmony with the river's bounty. The villagers, guided by the wisdom of their ancestors, established a tradition that echoed the river's magical essence. Every first of the month, at the precise hour of three in the afternoon, they would embark on a grand procession, traversing the length of the village, following the river's winding path.
<br>
<br>
Upon reaching the Clear Blue Diamond Lake, a mesmerizing body of water that mirrored the heavens, the villagers would plunge into its depths, their hearts filled with anticipation. The lake, as if responding to their collective desire, would reveal its hidden treasures, scattering diamonds across the surface like a shower of celestial sparks.
<br>
<br>
This extraordinary spectacle drew visitors from far and wide, each hoping to witness the magical transformation and perhaps claim a diamond of their own. From the bustling streets of distant cities to the tranquil shores of neighboring kingdoms, people journeyed to Diamond Village, their eyes sparkling with excitement and a touch of disbelief.
<br>
<br>
On this particular first of the month, a young woman named Ash joined the throng of eager participants. Ash, accompanied by her loyal canine companion, Ruffus, had traveled from a distant land, her heart filled with a mix of curiosity and determination. She had heard tales of the Marvelous Diamond River and the village that lay at its end, tales of wonder and enchantment that had captured her imagination.
<br>
<br>
As the procession reached the Clear Blue Diamond Lake, Ash and Ruffus joined the mass of divers, their bodies plunging into the cool, refreshing waters. Around them, the air was filled with a collective gasp as the surface of the lake ignited with a dazzling display of diamonds, their brilliance reflecting the sun's radiant rays.

Ash's heart swelled with joy as she held the sparkling diamond, its facets twinkling like a constellation of stars. She had not only witnessed the magic of the Marvelous Diamond River but had also become part of its enduring legend.

The excitement in the air was palpable as villagers prepared for the feast, sharing stories of their diamond dives and exchanging laughter.

Ash found a quiet spot by the lake, where the gentle lapping of the water provided a soothing backdrop. Ruffus settled down beside her, his eyes gleaming with contentment. As the villagers reveled in the festivities, Ash indulged in the delightful pastries, savoring each bite.

I've been thinking of a name for my project because I kept the project name "Morpheus Project". It's a project name, but I want a really cool name for my device and assistant. Why not keep Morpheus? or find another name?
