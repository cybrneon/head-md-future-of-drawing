# Progress of the day
## Tasks

### Done
- ~~Find a better solution for the pen detection, putting weight into the top of the pen like lead (plomb), and not using ugly wood.~~ -> I solved this by putting my Caran d'Ache pen, it's not a pencil. I'll keep testing if I put multiple pens for example. 
- ~~Story generation with AI.~~ I generated one story and edited it in my DAW, also added sound effects as it was something people told me (during test days) would have immersed them more.
- ~~Software corrections and boot setup.~~ Set script to autorun at boot.
- ~~Back up sd card!~~ Done.
- ~~Label the cables so I can recognize which cable is which.~~ Done.

### What's remaining
- Finding how to hide the RPI.
- Presentation and finish Project Documentation
