# Progress of the day
## Tasks

### Done
- ~~Find a better solution for the pen detection, putting weight into the top of the pen like lead (plomb), and not using ugly wood.~~ -> I solved this by putting my Caran d'Ache pen, it's not a pencil. I'll keep testing if I put multiple pens for example. 
- ~~Story generation with AI.~~ I generated one story and edited it in my DAW, also added sound effects as it was something people told me (during test days) would have immersed them more.
- ~~Software corrections and boot setup.~~ Set script to autorun at boot.
- ~~Back up sd card!~~ Done.
- ~~Label the cables so I can recognize which cable is which.~~ Done.

### What's remaining
- Finding how to hide the RPI.
- Presentation and finish Project Documentation

## Other stuff
I also put a startup and shutdown sound to the RPI so I now if everything's going according to plan, but they don't work. Probably because the RPI initializes the GPIO at the end of the boot sequence? compared to the 3.5mm jack or HDMI.

Also, the autorun for my python script runs and then cuts quickly. I need to remove and put the pen again for it to work. But that's fine for the presentation.
