# Defining an Identity for the physical object

## Comments while talking with Laure
- I probably need a physical surface, inste3ad of a spatial experience.
- The HOW can become accessories; sometimes drawing with a squishy ball, another with a hard ball, etc...
- Maybe cards can get out from the device, like the UNO spitter.
- Probably better to feel the different pens, the different feelings of the pens.
- To then show the drawing to the user at the end, I need a low-tech display, something not that "stimulant".
- I also need to think about the sensors and if they're stored in the pen at the bottom or the top.
- I need to check mindfulness and rituals devices, not only tech things. Also I can check things from other cultures.
- I need to think about the dimensions and if it's on a table for example or a furniture, etc.
- Finaly, for the CdA presentation, I need to design a clean prototype.

# Answering these questions from Laure's presentation
## Pitch and user scenario
### Is my pitch clear?
Yes, but it needs to be reshaped.

### Is my user scenario clear?
Yes, mostly.

### What physical (or virtual 3d) objects are necessary to carry out the user scenario?
- A central compute unit with a display and speakers (with a physical card spitter?)
- A finger sensor similar to an axiometer sensor <b>/or/</b> sensors baked on a pen <b>/or/</b> No external sensor to the principal device, but kinect sensors inside.

## Target Audience
### Who is my target audience and in which context shall my project be evolving?
People struggling with daily stress.

### Field? Age groupe? Interests? Environment?
Youngsters from 16 to 30?

### Document this through visuals. Assemble in a moodbaord.
How? Pictures of people struggling with daily stress?

## Competition Research
### Identify the competition
Meditation devices

### Document this through visuals. Assemble in a moodboard.

## Reference Images
### From here try to find reference images that come from other contexts and express the shape, the aesthetic, the materials, the finish you would like to develop. Assemble these in one moodboard. Develop 2-3 different moodboard options.

## Start Sketching!
### Start with first shapes:
- Sketched on paper
- Sketched in 3d
- Collages or reference images
- Paper prototypes
Think of the scale
Think of the material

# The Pitch (WIP)
(Name goes here) is a stimulating creative AI assistant that seamlessly integrates with your morning routine with the goal of reducing daily stress using spatial drawing and storytelling.
<br>
You can use the device in the morning, at home; before going to school or work, or just after waking up. It's up to you to setup your own routine.
<br>
The experience is a complete _voyage_, while having your eyes closed,  into another world. After this 3-5min trip, you're taken back to Earth, or real life.
<br>
The machine automatically and randomly picks one WHAT and one HOW card. The WHAT cards indicate the subject of the drawing and scenarios, and the HOW card indicate the way the user should draw.
<br>
When drawing, you use a small device resembling a pulse oxiometer, that allows you to draw in the air. This device captures the drawing you're currently doing and displays it at the end of the experience.
<br>
The assistant that picked the cards for you will comment and ask questions at the same time you're drawing, and immerse you into the scenario you picked.

# The User Journey (WIP)
1. The user turns the assistant ON by tapping on it. The assistant then detects the stress level of the person according to the force they used to tap on the device.
2. The assistant will randomly select one WHAT and one HOW card and display them for the user.
3. The assistant asks the user to wear a small device on their finger, close their eyes and get ready for a 3 to 5 minutes countdown.
4. The user begins drawing in the air with the sensor on its finger, according to the WHAT and HOW cards that were picked.
5. At the same time, the assistant will give comments and ask questions in real time. If the user picked the "Draw a Map of a City" card, the questions could be:
    - What Time is it?
    - How are people dressed?
    - Is there a smell or particular odor you have in mind?
6. At the end of the countdown and the experience, the display shows the final drawing, and the user has the option to save it.
7. The user should feel better. If not, the experience can be relaunched.
8. The assistant says goodbye and turns OFF.

# Testing scenarios and scripts with people
I tested the same scenario with two people, one with a HOW card and the other without one.

### Subject 1
The one without was able to fully immerse herself into the scenario and didn't see the time passing (The subject did more than the 5 minutes of required time, but I didnt't tell her when the time was up).

### Subject 2
The second one with the HOW card "Draw while kneeling" had trouble concentrating and was less immersed into the virtual world. <b>So I probably need to rethink the HOW cards, just like Laure said (changing it to a brush feeling?).</b>
