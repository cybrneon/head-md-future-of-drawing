# Defining an Identity for the physical object

## Comments while talking with Laure
- I probably need a physical surface, instead of a spatial experience.
- The HOW can become accessories; sometimes drawing with a squishy ball, another with a hard ball, etc...
- Maybe cards can get out from the device, like the UNO spitter.
- Probably better to feel the different pens, the different feelings of the pens.
- To then show the drawing to the user at the end, I need a low-tech display, something not that "stimulant".
- I also need to think about the sensors and if they're stored in the pen at the bottom or the top.
- I need to check mindfulness and rituals devices, not only tech things. Also I can check things from other cultures.
- I need to think about the dimensions and if it's on a table for example or a furniture, etc.
- Finaly, for the CdA presentation, I need to design a clean prototype.

## Reference Images
### From here try to find reference images that come from other contexts and express the shape, the aesthetic, the materials, the finish you would like to develop. Assemble these in one moodboard. Develop 2-3 different moodboard options.
