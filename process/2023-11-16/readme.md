# The Day
I presented the concept of Project Morpheus, sickly.

## Feedback
- Pretty clear
- The simplification of the device's shape is good.
- I have to think, to the core, if closing your eyes is necessary. Maybe the assistant can ask the user to make themselves comfortable before drawing. Or it could be something hybrid, like the assistant asks the user to close their eyes and reopen them when needed for a few seconds to draw a sun for example.

## New Ideas I've got before the presentation
- Yesterday while showering, I thought about making pens with chips inside, that gets detected when you put them in the pen holder and it gives a specific story. CdA can sell pens that enable stories with different drawing sensations.
- This morning while taking the elevator, I thought about how the pen holder can become a smart speaker + voice assistant. When you start the experience, the device can trigger the blinds and the lights? With connected devices, can lead to augmented experiences?

# Afternoon
## Personal Impressions
It was kind of a challenging and new way of thinking that we learned, and it was really hard getting used to that. I think the fun part is coming up and it's going to be more interesting as we finally make our assistants come alive.

I'm probably scared about the part where we'll do electronics, even tho I'm interested in that. I'm scared of the courses and tutorials being too technical and less creative, but we'll see. I already had a course with Pierre, so I know it's going to be fun.

I'm also tired because I'm finishing this phase with a cold or something.

## Getting ahead of the curve
Thinking about the inputs and ouputs I have, in groups.
##### INPUT
Button or Detector for the pen in the pen holder

##### OUTPUT
Speaker
