# Prototyping? with Paper!
## First Try
At first, I drew the following cards:
- Inks
- Poker Face
- Figuration
- Peltier

I then made an interactive Captcha machine that asks you to draw something on it to confirm you're human, with a voice that asks you why you're drawing things the way you're drawing them and not giving any emotion.
