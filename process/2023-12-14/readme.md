# TEST DAY !!!!

Today, I tested my stories to multiple three people and got interesting insights.

## Morning
Even tho it wasn't the best conditions (calm & alone), I tested on Narges. Luka said that it gave him the desire to draw even tho he didn't try it and just listened to me narrating the stories.

They mentioned pausing the story, give time to draw and not miss the story.

On the second story, Narges found it too complicated because there were too much info. But at the same time, this version gives much more freedom, and you can care more about the story. So she prefers the second one! She loves it.

Luka mentionned testing on children.

Maybe I can have a simple summary at the beginning, slower on the story to introduce people and give them time before diving into more complex stuff?

## Afternoon
First person of the afternoon, Flore, said it was too fast and surprisingly, and unexpectedly, stopped the experience on the first story.

Flore said it went too fast, and maybe I should think of having multiple modes. One simple, another more detailed? She also thought about having sounds or music? for example when I begin with the river you can hear water sounds.

Jonas also mentionned having a feather at the top of the pen or something to make it more majestic and more dynamic.

Elie on the other hand, loved the experience and the way I narrated it. He talked about the fact that when he was drawing, he had trouble changing views (mountains to lakeside for ex.). He mentionned that i needed to be careful with the camera. He couldn't do a scene because he didn't have space at the bottom of the page so he put it at the top.

He also told me that he would have enjoyed something without sense, something abstract that plays with the subconscious and can help with the creation. He talked of stuff that doesn't make sense like shapes and colors mixed with the story. (I tought this could go well with AI).

He also said that using text to speech could leave the humanity of my voice behind. The second text also had much more atmosphere compared to the first one.

One last note, having two modes is not a bad idea. Like a direct mode that speaks and narrates a story. And another Subconscient mode that would mix with different and not related stuff (dÃ©lirer!).

## Quick Talk with Laure before the end of the day
We quickly talked about the shape realization in metal.
But also, about the aluminium spray I wanted to do, to mimic real aluminium or metal.
Laure gave me a big no, because it doesn't end up like you want it to end up, soooo I'll obey and trust Laure on that ðŸ«¡.
