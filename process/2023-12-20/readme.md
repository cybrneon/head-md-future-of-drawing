# Talking about the shape with Laure

## Corrections to do to my shape
We talked about the top part, where I should do a staircase thing.
We talked about the speaker cylinder and how it sticks to the other parts with the textile.
We also talked about how the textile will fit and how it will be folded on the inside.

## At the same time
- I booked a 3d print at the prototyping atelier for the 8th of Jan 24.
- I launched a print of a low quality print at the Pool Num√©rique (I should get it the day after).
- I'm trying to make the RPI function with the speaker bonnet and the speakers. Nothing works and I don't know why. I checked blogs, online, videos and lots of people seem to have the same problem without a real fix...
