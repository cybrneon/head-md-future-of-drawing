# Initializing PHASE III

## To catch up with the project...

### Pitch
(Name goes here) is a stimulating creative AI assistant that seamlessly integrates with your morning routine with the goal of reducing daily stress using spatial drawing.
<br>
You can start the device in the morning, at home; before going to school or work, or just after waking up. It's up to you to setup your own routine.
<br>
The experience is a complete _voyage_, while having your eyes closed,  into another world. After this 3-5min trip, you're taken back to Earth, or real life.
<br>
The machine automatically and randomly picks one WHAT and one HOW card. The WHAT cards indicate the subject of the drawing and scenarios, and the HOW card indicate the way the user should draw.
<br>
When drawing, you use a small device resembling a pulse oxiometer, that allows you to draw in the air. This device captures the drawing you're currently doing and displays it at the end of the experience.
<br>
The assistant that picked the cards for you will comment and ask questions at the same time you're drawing, and immerse you into the scenario you picked.


### User Journey
1. The user turns the assistant ON by tapping on it. The assistant then detects the stress level of the person according to the force they used to tap on the device.
2. The assistant will randomly select one WHAT and one HOW card and display them for the user.
3. The assistant asks the user to wear a small device on their finger, close their eyes and get ready for a 3 to 5 minutes countdown.
4. The user begins drawing in the air with the sensor on its finger, according to the WHAT and HOW cards that were picked.
5. At the same time, the assistant will give comments and ask questions in real time. If the user picked the "Draw a Map of a City" card, the questions could range be:
    - What Time is it?
    - How are people dressed?
    - Is there a smell or particular odor you have in mind?
6. At the end of the countdown and the experience, the display shows the final drawing, and the user has the option to save it.
7. The user should feel better. If not, the experience can be relaunched.
8. The assistant says goodbye and turns off.

### Key Insights
**Routine:** Setting up a routine in the morning or afternoon can be beneficial. Ex: Doing an exercise for 5min in the morning or before bed.
<br>
**Stress Level Rating:** Listening to the user's stress level and providing the adequate solution.
<br>
**Positive Comments:** Reassuring the user that he's drawing nicely, and maybe provide comments and suggestions (always positive).
<br>
**Guiding:** Helping users navigate their drawing, giving them inspiration and igniting things they didn't think about. All for them to be better immersed in their drawing.
