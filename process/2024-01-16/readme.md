# Preparing for the _keynote_

Today is a bit more relaxed than the others. I'm putting the final touches to the pitch deck Powerpoint.

I also need to provide an example of how the AI will work.
Here are small sentences that I can explain with:

Once upon a time, a small kitten called Teddy, was from the Orange Cats Village, north of Kyoto.

He left his family to embark on a journey across the world.

His boat had an engine failure, and he thought he was going to die.

Fortunately, Teddy had some mechanic skills, so he fixed his boat.

Teddy disembarked at San Francisco where he planned to visit Silicon Valley.

In the tranquil embrace of the Orange Cats Village, nestled amidst the verdant hills that skirted the outskirts of Kyoto, resided a spirited kitten named Teddy. Unlike his placid feline companions, content to bask in the warmth of their sheltered existence, Teddy yearned for the thrill of exploration, his heart set on embarking on a grand voyage that would traverse the boundless expanse of the world. With a knapsack brimming with dreams and a spirit ablaze with courage, Teddy bid farewell to his beloved family, ready to embark on his daring quest.

His journey began with a sturdy wooden sailboat, his trusty vessel as he sailed across the tempestuous seas. The sun beat down upon his fur, the wind whispered tales of distant shores, and the waves danced with a rhythm that echoed his adventurous spirit. But amidst the thrill of the open water, disaster struck. A sudden mechanical malfunction rendered Teddy's sailboat helpless, adrift in the vast ocean. Fear gripped his heart, the specter of death looming large.

However, Teddy's spirit remained unbroken. Drawing upon his innate ingenuity and a knack for mechanics inherited from his father, the village blacksmith, he set about repairing his beloved boat. With nimble paws and a determination that surpassed his size, he tinkered and patched, his tiny hands working tirelessly. Days turned into nights, and nights into days, but Teddy persevered, his determination fueled by an unwavering belief in his ability to overcome any obstacle.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Teddy's labors bore fruit. The engine roared back to life, its rhythmic hum filling Teddy with a surge of triumph. With renewed vigor, he steered his repaired sailboat towards the horizon, his heart set on reaching the shores of San Francisco, a city pulsating with innovation and dreams.

After weeks of traversing the vast ocean, Teddy finally reached San Francisco, his eyes wide with wonder at the towering skyscrapers and the vibrant energy that permeated the city. With eager paws, he ventured into Silicon Valley, a Mecca for tech enthusiasts and aspiring entrepreneurs.

As he navigated the bustling streets, Teddy's eyes were drawn to the creativity and passion that ignited the air. He observed teams of engineers huddled around computers, their minds racing with ideas for the future. He watched as entrepreneurs pitched their groundbreaking concepts, their voices filled with the determination to make their marks on the world.

Inspired by the spirit of innovation that permeated Silicon Valley, Teddy felt a surge of inspiration within himself. He envisioned himself joining forces with these remarkable minds, contributing his own unique talents to the pursuit of technological advancements.

With newfound determination, Teddy sought out opportunities to collaborate with the brilliant minds of Silicon Valley. His mechanical skills and problem-solving abilities proved invaluable, and he quickly found himself immersed in a world of cutting-edge technology.

As Teddy's contributions grew, so did his reputation. He became known as the "Kitten Engineer," a symbol of ingenuity and resourcefulness. His story spread throughout Silicon Valley, inspiring others to embrace their passions and pursue their dreams, no matter how unconventional or improbable they may seem.

Teddy's journey from the tranquil Orange Cats Village to the bustling heart of Silicon Valley was a testament to the power of perseverance, creativity, and the unwavering belief in one's potential. He had transformed from a curious kitten seeking adventure into a respected engineer, his impact resonating far beyond his wildest dreams.
