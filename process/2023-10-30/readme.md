# Log of the 30th of Oct

Experimenting with paper prototypes and [the cards game](https://www.jeudecartesperformatif.com/cartes/1MmepmjIUgUEHXa6AlJGlBwEgH5gafYYQm4ylukJmILQ).

## The First Concept
After the experimentation, it was time to form a first Concept.
Thinking of personalities like Dreamy, A bit too much, Spy, Cheerleader.

## Important Insights
**Routine:** Setting up a routine in the morning or afternoon can be beneficial. Ex: Doing an exercise for 5min in the morning or before bed.
**Stress Level Rating:** Listening to the user's stress level and providing the adequate solution as a drawing experience.
**Positive Comments:** Reassuring the user that he's drawing nicely, and maybe provide comments and suggestions (always positive).
**A box:** A small device that can be put in a living room and blend with its space. Ex: Hi-Fi, TV, Clock, Books, Game console, ...
**Interactions:**
- Tap to wake? at the top?
- No smartphone interaction! (no stress in the morning)
- K.I.S.S.
- Was thinking of a sensor attached to a pen, but I think it would be more intereseting to "draw" in the air, with nothing but a sensor (Wii-mote, Kinect). -> Drawing in a space without knowing what you're drawing is pretty interesting. (I have to test that!!!)

## How can the machine function?
1. Turn the machine on (wake it up) by tapping at the top.

2. By that, I communicate the level of stress I'm feeling right now.
3. The machine gives me a prompt to draw with a WHAT and a HOW.
4. With the pen (or the sensor on the finger), the machine understands what I'm drawing and comments on it.
5. After drawing for 3 to 5 minutes, time is up! The machine now shows you the art you've created, and asks you how it went so that it can adapt to you.

## Comments I got from Alexia, Douglas and collegues:
- I need to challenge myself by removing text, and screens (no chatbot-like interactions)
- Be careful not to do too much industrial design. I should focus more on the interactions.
- The routine question is interesting and important. Need to do more research about that.
