## The Pitch
Project Morpheus is an AI assistant that narrates stories to you while drawing with your eyes closed.
<br>
Each time you turn on the device by lifting the pen from the device, youâ€™re guided by the assistant into a virtual world where a story is narrated to you.
<br>
Each day, you get one episode to draw and each episode can be part of a series, just like a Netflix series, creating a ritual of drawing every day.
<br>
The experience is a complete voyage, while having your eyes closed, into another world. Before going back to earth after a five minute journey.

## User Journey or Scenario
1. The user turns the assistant ON by removing a pen from the pen holder.
2. The assistant will pick a scenario based on the day and progression in the story of the series.
3. The assistant asks the user to open their notebook, close their eyes and get ready for a 5 minutes countdown.
4. The user begins drawing.
5. While the user is drawing, the assistant will start narrating the story. The narration could look like:
	- There was a light blue river flowing from the north.
	- The Californian trees, fresh out of the fall are everywhere.
	- Grass is growing at a precedented pace.
6. At the end of the countdown, the assistant asks the user to open their eyes.
7. The user now sees their drawing in front of them.
8. The assistant says goodbye and turns OFF.

# Discussion with Alexia and Douglas
Pretty interesting discussion! I rebuilt confidence for the project with the help of the teachers and now I just need to change the pitch and adapt the user journey.
