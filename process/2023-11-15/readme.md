## The Pitch
Project Morpheus is a stimulating creative AI assistant that seamlessly integrates with your morning routine with the goal of reducing daily stress using drawing and storytelling.
<br>
You can use the device in the morning, at home; before going to school or work, or just after waking up. It's up to you to setup your own routine.
<br>
The experience is a complete _voyage_, while having your eyes closed,  into another world.
<br>
Each time you turn on the device, you're guided by the assistant into a random virtual world where the assistant asks questions about the scenario you're drawing, giving you insights, trying to influence your drawing and guiding you into a virtual environement. Before going back to earth, or real life, after a five minute journey.

## User Journey or Scenario
1. The user turns the assistant ON by removing a pen from the pen holder.
2. The assistant will pick a scenario based on the pen the user took.
3. The assistant asks the user to close their eyes and get ready for a 5 minutes countdown.
4. The user begins drawing.
5. While the user is drawing, the assistant will give comments and ask questions in real time. If the user picked the "Draw a Map of a City" card, the questions could be:
    - What Time is it?
    - How are people dressed?
    - Is there a smell or particular odor you have in mind?
6. At the end of the countdown, the assistant asks the user to open their eyes.
7. The user now sees their drawing in front of them.
8. The assistant says goodbye and turns OFF.
