# Today's work

I took the comments from yesterday and now I'm establishing a narration for one of the WHATs (for the moment).

I'm currently working on it on the [Figjam Board](https://www.figma.com/file/ohNOqJvYwTzFk34S5s9SKd/Atelier-MD1---Mind-Map-%2B-Field-Research?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=kX4MsfZhFvSkIcbM-1).

# THE Naration
The goal is to take a trip into an other world and coming back to the real world, feeling better.

# GMeet with Douglas
The idea of a guide, l'accompagnement, (I thought about Matrix) Morpeus qui accompagne les gens, Orph√©e qui s'occupe du royaume des morts (mythologie greque), is pretty interesting.

I'm not going to cure people, but I'm gonna nudge them, support them.

I just have to be careful not to ask a lot of people, all while pushing them into their immaginary (just like Morpheus).

I can do A/B testing with people, using two different scenarios.
, but I quickly need to try and experiment with people.

The idea of cards now is not super important, I need to focus on the intention that I communicate to people.

For the presentation with CdA in two weeks, I can develop the current "Draw a map of a city" scenario but can do another just to give an example, so the jurys can understand.
