# Thinking Industrial Design and Electronics

## Working on the industrial design
I'm working on the prototype with Fusion 360, not Rhino.

## Talking with Laure & Pierre about the project
Interesting conversation!
- No RFID or NFC chip because its probably too confusing for the sensors and it won't work.
- No multi pens, just for the demo and experience of January, but I can mention having multiple pens in the future, with each pen a chip and different drawing experience.
- Need an amp to power the speaker.
- Simple project to realize, which is good.
- Now for the materials, I need to rethink the use of plastic, textile and aluminium and how I'll design the object, thinking of how we'll make the objects or print them (That will come soon with Laure).
- <b>Either an Arduino or a Rasberry Pi (Zero)</b>

## Talking with Douglas
Need to think if I want to make my assistant generative for the demo in January or not. Douglas says he's here for that, so I can count on him.

## List of electronics
Simply,
- Pen detection (sensitive button, weight, micro-switch)
- Speaker (either 3.5 jack or the Google Home Mini one :D)
- Amp for Speaker (SWITCH for Arduino)
- Check the Libraries


I need to think of the support for the exhibition.
