The story for the demo shouldn't be long as I won't have that much time to go through all the story.

### #Introduction
Once upon a time, a river.

Rolling down the Akira Mountains, north of the coutry of Selestia.

At the end of the river, a small village, built by a couple after they encountered diamonds in the river.

The couple, named Gigi governed the small village for a few years now, they even have their own palace.

Each year, the tradition states that every first of the month at 3PM, people run from the north to the south of the village, following the river, and dive into the Clear Blue Diamond Lake for a chance to find diamonds.

The lakeside is full of people coming from a number of different countries, here to witness the miracle, and why not be part of it.

**Chapter 1: The Marvelous Diamond River**

Nestled amidst the rugged peaks of the Akira Mountains, north of the enchanting country of Selestia, flowed a river of unparalleled beauty, its crystalline waters shimmering like a ribbon of diamonds under the sun's golden gaze. This was the Marvelous Diamond River, a natural wonder that had captivated the hearts of travelers and adventurers for generations.

Its allure extended beyond its visual splendor, as the river was said to hold a secret treasure – diamonds of unimaginable brilliance and size. It was said that these precious gems were scattered throughout the riverbed, waiting to be unearthed by the lucky and determined.

Hundreds of years ago, a humble couple named Gigi stumbled upon this hidden treasure while traversing the mountains. Overwhelmed by the beauty and wealth they had discovered, they decided to settle at the river's end, establishing a small village that would become known as Diamond River Village.

As word of the river's magical properties spread, people from all corners of the world flocked to the village, eager to participate in the annual diamond-hunting ritual. Each first day of the month, at precisely 3 pm, a mass exodus would occur, as villagers and visitors alike embarked on a spirited race from the northernmost point of the river to its southernmost end.

The race culminated in a grand plunge into the Clear Blue Diamond Lake, a tranquil oasis nestled at the river's southern extremity. The lake's depths were believed to hold the greatest concentration of diamonds, and as the participants emerged from their underwater treasure hunt, their faces were often etched with excitement, revealing the fruits of their efforts.

One such participant was Ash, a young adventurer with a thirst for exploration and a spirit of adventure. Ash had long dreamed of witnessing the legendary diamond hunt and, armed with their trusty canine companion, Ruffus, they set off to Diamond River Village, determined to be a part of the magical spectacle.

As Ash and Ruffus arrived at the lakeside, they were immediately swept up in the vibrant energy of the crowd. The air was filled with a mix of anticipation and excitement, as murmurs of potential diamond finds echoed through the throng.

After completing the exhilarating race and emerging from the lake, Ash was greeted by an unexpected sight – a newly opened restaurant called O'Diamond, its inviting aroma wafting through the air and tantalizing their senses.

Curiosity piqued, Ash decided to indulge in a culinary adventure, leading Ruffus towards the inviting establishment. As they stepped inside, they were greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere, the scent of freshly baked bread and savory stews filling the air.

Ash's eyes widened in delight as they took in the sight of the restaurant's menu, a tantalizing array of dishes that showcased the region's unique culinary heritage. The decision was difficult, but Ash ultimately settled on a hearty stew made with locally sourced ingredients, accompanied by a side of freshly baked cornbread.

As they savored their meal, Ash couldn't help but marvel at the serendipitous discovery of O'Diamond. It was as if the restaurant had appeared out of thin air, offering a welcome respite from the day's excitement and a chance to indulge in the flavors of the region.

With their hunger satiated and their spirits lifted, Ash and Ruffus continued their exploration of Diamond River Village, drawn by the captivating charm of the place. The river's shimmering waters, the vibrant energy of the villagers, and the aroma of delicious food created an unforgettable sensory experience.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the village, Ash knew that this was just the beginning of their adventure in the Marvelous Diamond River. With Ruffus by their side, they were ready to immerse themselves in the village's rich culture and explore the hidden treasures that lay scattered throughout its enchanting landscape.
