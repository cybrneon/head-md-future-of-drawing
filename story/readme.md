# Story

### #Introduction
Once upon a time, a river.

Rolling down the Akira Mountains, north of the coutry of Selestia.

At the end of the river, a small village, built by a couple after they encountered diamonds in the river.

And this is why the river is called the Marvelous Diamond River.

The couple, named Gigi governed the small village for a few years now, they even have their own palace.

Each year, the tradition states that every first of the month at 3PM, people run from the north to the south of the village, following the river, and dive into the Clear Blue Diamond Lake for a chance to find diamonds.

The lakeside is full of people coming from a number of different countries, here to witness the miracle, and why not be part of it.

### #Event1
That day in the crowd, a person by the name of Ash just finished their run and dive, was standing next to the lake thinking of what she'll be eating this evening.

Ash came to the lakeside with their dog, Ruffus.
